# Countbucket
Lists all your Bitbucket commits that matches a given criteria.

## Goal
The goal of this app is to aid the process of generating a software baseline by searching all Git commits within a specific range of time.

Future implementations should feature validating commits' messages and branches.

## Using
Just clone the repository and use `$ npm install` to install all dependencies.

Then run `$ node app.js` and ask the prompt questions. The program output will be logged to the console and to a log file as well.
